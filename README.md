# EyeRIS Zoom Drive

## Overview
This repo contains the models and associated part to build a remote zoom controller for a Canon 70-200 mm zoom lens. The goal is to enable a relatively simple path to building remote zoom control for DSLR and Mirrorless full frame lenses.

## Using the existing models
The models in this repro should work well with the second generation of the Canon 70-200 mm EF mount zoom lens. The parts were printed on a Multijet Fusion printer and have been tested during many field trials.

## Adapting the models to a new lens
In general, this approach should work well for a range of lenses with manual zoom control. The appropriate motor, spur gear, and 3D printed gear will depend on the diameter of the zoom barrel on the lens and the required torque. This repo includes a part that can br printed to measure the torque needed to activate the zoom lens.
